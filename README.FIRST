******************************* IMPORTANT *************************************

  ************ Note for those who don't bother reading docs ***************
  * - Reading INSTALL is now a must, as the old DPATH is now specified    *
  *   when configure is run.                                              *
  *   You now need to ./configure --prefix="/path/to/install/it"          *
  * - The old config format WILL NOT WORK.  Please see etc/example.conf ! *
  * - The old kline format WILL NOT WORK.  Please use convertklines which *
  *   will be installed with your ircd!					  *
  *************************************************************************

  ALSO, IF YOU ARE UPGRADING YOUR CURRENT SOURCE TREE, AND YOU TRY TO BUILD
  IN IT WITHOUT PERFORMING AT LEAST 'make clean', THINGS _WILL_ BREAK.  IT IS
  RECOMMENDED THAT YOU RUN 'make distclean' AND THEN RERUN './configure'!

******************************* REQUIREMENTS **********************************

Necessary Requirements:

- A supported platform (look below)

- A working dynamic load library, unless
  compiling statically, without module
  support.

- A working lex.  Solaris /usr/ccs/bin/lex
  appears to be broken, on this system flex
  should be used.

- A working bison or byacc.  FreeBSD and BSD/OS
  byacc are broken in some releases, and will
  dump core when building the ircd_parser.y. The
  solution to this is to upgrade to the most
  recent release, or to simply obtain a current
  copy of byacc (such as building source from
  FreeBSD CVS/CVSup). This is fixed in FreeBSD
  4.4-STABLE and later.

Feature Specific Requirements:

- For the SSL Challenge controlled OPER feature and encrypted server links,
  a working OpenSSL library

- For compressed server links,
  a working zlib library and includes (zlib.h)

- For encrypted oper and (optional) server passwords, a working DES and/or
  MD5 library

*******************************************************************************

- To report bugs in hybrid, send the bug report to ircd-hybrid@the-project.org

- Known bugs are listed in the BUGS file

- See the INSTALL document for info on configuring and compiling
  ircd-hybrid.

- Please read doc/index.txt to get an overview of the current documentation.

- Old Hybrid 5/6 configuration files are no longer supported.  All conf
  files will have to be converted to the Hybrid 7 format.  A convertconf
  utility is provided and installed into bin/.

- If you are wondering why config.h no longer exists, it's because most
  things that were once in config.h are now specified in the 'general'
  block of ircd.conf.  Look at example.conf for more information about
  these options. Many, notably syslog support and EFnet tweaks, are now
  configure options (see ./configure --help for details.)

- /etc/resolv.conf is at present required to exist for our resolver to start
  properly.

- There is now a mailing list for general discussion of Hybrid.  To subscribe
  to the Hybrid List, send email to listmanager@the-project.org with
  the subject "subscribe hybrid".

- If you run in to a problem you think may be specific to your platform,
  check README.PLATFORMS for some hints.

- SOLARIS USERS: this code appears to tickle a bug in older gcc and 
  egcs ONLY on 64-bit Solaris7.  gcc-2.95 and SunPro C on 64bit should
  work fine, and any gcc or SunPro compiled on 32bit.

- DARWIN AND MACOS X USERS: You must be using at least the December 2001
  Development Tools from Apple to build ircd-hybrid with shared modules.
  Before then you MUST disable shared modules, as we do not have the proper
  flags for cc(1) prior to that point to produce shared modules.

- TESTED PLATFORMS:  The code has been tested on the following platforms, and
  is known to run properly.
  FreeBSD 3.x/4.x/5.x (gcc only, TenDRA will *not* work)
  Linux glibc 2.2/2.3
  Solaris 2.6/7/8
  Cygwin 1.3.22 (no shared modules yet)
  OpenBSD 2.8-3.2
  HP-UX 11.00-11.22
  IRIX64 6.5.19 (gcc only; MIPSpro is unconfirmed)
  NetBSD 1.4-1.6
  Tru64 UNIX 5.2b (only tested with native cc)
  
  It probably does not compile on AIX or libc5 Linux.
  
  Previously, OpenVMS was actively supported, but the port has fallen behind,
  so a diff is available in contrib/ that may or may not work for you. Use at
  your own risk.
