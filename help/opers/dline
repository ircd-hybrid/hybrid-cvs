DLINE <nick|ip> :[reason] [| oper reason]

Adds a DLINE to the ircd.conf or dline.conf file
which will deny any connections from the IP address
of the banned client.  The banned client will receive
a message saying he/she is banned with reason [reason]

If an oper reason is added (the pipe must be specified
to seperate the fields) this will be added into the
dline.conf but will not be shown to the user when they
are given the dline reason.

In order to use <nick> rather than <ip>, <nick> must
be on your server.

- Requires Oper Priv: K
