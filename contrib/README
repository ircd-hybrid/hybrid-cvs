This directory contains modules and patches that have been contributed
by other people, or aren't suitable for including into the 
hybrid tree. The coding team do not officially support the contrib/ 
modules, or guarantee any of them will actually work.

There is also a lone ircII script (challenge.irc) that works along with
rsa_respond so you can authenticate within your client.

Once again. WITH feeling. Not all of these modules have been thoroughly
tested! That's why some of them are in contrib not in the main tree yet.
At least one module in contrib has been known to core servers when used.
You have been warned. 

To repeat, ONE OR MORE OF THESE MAY CRASH YOUR SERVER.  USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK.
