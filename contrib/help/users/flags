FLAGS [-|+ flag]

The FLAGS command is designed to enable or disable user mode flags in plain english.
The idea is to make it easier to toggle flags without having to remember their letter.

If you run FLAGS without any extra parameters or arguments you'll get an example listing:

--- Current flags: SWALLOPS SNOTICES INVISIBLE CALLERID
--- Current missing flags: OKILLS SKILLS

So if you want to enable CALLERID (+g) for instance you do

FLAGS +CALLERID and you can disable it with FLAGS -CALLERID
