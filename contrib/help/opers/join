JOIN <#channel1[,#channel2,#channel3...]> [!vchan] [key]

The JOIN command allows you to enter a public chat area known as
a channel. Network wide channels are proceeded by a '#', while
a local server channel is proceeded by an '&'. You can join more
than one channel at a time, separating their names with comma's (',').

The second argument, if supplied, joins the specified virtual
channel <vchan>.

If the channel has a key set, the third argument must be
given to enter. This allows channels to be password protected.
