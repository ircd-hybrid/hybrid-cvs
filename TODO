- add more stderr debugging (ircd -s)... one for every place we syslog()
- ircd -s doesn't work through a restart
- change nick instead of kill on nick collide
- dynamically extensible parser for modules
- modularize channel, network code etc (not just commands)
    we can use override_function() or similar for this
- username/passwords (iauth ?)
- Make stats p just notice opers, rather than return a list, when
  server_hide is on (#13)
- Definable server region or 'global' (open I) for /links output (#20)
- make the reserved FD limit run-time tunable, esp from comm_open()
  This involves making fd_table[] a dynamically growing/(don't bother with
  shrinking) list.. have the max fd list configurable in the conf file..

- Fix the anti-client flood code to not be so anal when people connect -
  I've counted all lines from a client as being a flood, so if a client
  connects and issues JOIN's to a whole bunch of channels the flood
  protection stops everything coming through at once .. (not that I mind.. :)

- In the server outbound connection code, make the sendto_realops()
  logging more sane. Ie, if there's an error, also log the errno string.

- look at the old Listener code in s_bsd.c before I chopped it. Notice
  the anti-flood code in there. Make sure the same load-checking stuff
  is in listener.c

- get send_message(), replace comm_setselect() with send_queued_write(), see
  if the optimization works

- Add the IRCnet(?) split logic for nick collisions - on a nick collision,
  change to "%d-%s", random, nick

Little things to be done given enough time and initiative -Hwy

.  <Riedel> walter : have you implemented the motd= thing in the auth block ?
.  Fix topic bursting to LL servers (broke lately for some reason)
.  A FAQ
.  More translations!


-- Rodder's list
.  Add scalable database-based authentication.  Probably part of Iauth.
   Also add support for server-side notify with the list stored in the
   auth database.  This would make ircd an awesome instant messaging
   back-end.


-- jdc's list
  *  Re-write m_stats.c to be table-based, similar to m_set.  Also change
     to support funtion exit code values (int), so that STATS output can
     be "successful" or "unsuccessful" (eg. "STATS i requested by <nick>
     [unsuccessful]" vs. "STATS i requested by <nick>").
     --> Table part I know is done, what about the success status?
  *  Re-write proper startup procedure for daemon; procedure should be
     done in stages, similar to boot0/1/2 stages in FreeBSD.


-- Diane's list

* add logging to ircd.log of possible channel floods

* add code to log a minute worth of flooding if the ircd gets n possible
  flood messages on a channel in t seconds.. This log would be available
  to hand to authorities if requested.

-- Josh's list

* Find out the status of the build with IRIX64/MIPSpro.
* Make modules.c more flexible in anticipation of Win32 modules usability.
* LAZY LINKS ARE BROKEN!!!
* TENDRA IS BROKEN! (Not quite our fault)
* Fix lack of error message for oper initiating /connect that fails because
it's a leaf.

-- metalrock's list

* Don't show local channels in a remote whois.
* Write documentation for example.conf changes.
