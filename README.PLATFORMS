IRCD-Hybrid Platforms Information

Sometimes problems and inconsistencies in the Hybrid code may only occur
on a specific platform (architecture and/or operating system and/or
compiler). In these cases you may want to directly contact a person who
is interested in maintaining Hybrid on that platform. Below is a list of
people who have jumped up and taken responsibility for Hybrid, including
making sure it compiles, runs, and doesn't crash.

Platforms marked with a '*' are known to be broken. In general,
README.FIRST will include specific notes on broken platforms.
