 Known Bugs worthy of a mention:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
1.  Issues with server hostmasking.
    - If for example the new servername is blah.blah.blah.nl, the following
      servernames will be checked, in this order: *.blah.blah.nl, *.blah.nl,
      *.nl, one of which will match the host-masked server they are
      connecting behind. This will be accepted by the host-masked server it
      is connected behind, but when it reaches the server the host-masked
      server is connected to, the find_server will match, so the host-masked
      server will be dropped.
      --> This corrected?

2.  /MODUNLOAD causes cores:
    - If a module is modified before being unloaded, /MODUNLOAD (and
      therefore /MODRELOAD) may cause a core.

      This problem is caused by the behaviour of the OS, which treats
      shared libraries differently to executables (modifying the ircd
      binary whilst it is running would also cause a core, but is denied
      by the OS). There is no way to fix this at the application level,
      and fixing the OS to do the right thing is also difficult.

      A workaround to avoid coring is possible however. To install new
      modules, first remove or rename the old module, then copy/move the
      new file into place. /MODUNLOAD will then work successfully.

      Alternatively, running ./configure with the --disable-shared-modules
      argument will link all the commands statically, losing the advantages
      of upgrading at runtime, but reducing the chances of accidentally
      coring your server.

3.  IAuthd is broken beyond belief. It does not work at this time. If this
    bothers you, fix it for us.

4.  Solaris stock 32bit stdio is limited to 256 fds. This breaks when using
    cryptlinks.

5.  Compiling using tinycc is incomplete and unsupported. Mostly the problem
    is that our name resolver code breaks. Caveat emptor.
