			   What's new in Hybrid 7.1
			   ------------------------

===================
supported platforms
===================

- We now support a completely new platform, Tru64 UNIX. It now configures and
  builds right out of the box. Thanks to HP's TestDrive program for their
  public access Tru64 boxen.
- We have mostly revamped the Windows Cygwin port, mostly thanks to some awesome
  sleuth and compile work from James LaPlant.
- The IRIX port has been brought up to date. Thanks to Mark Laws for access to a
  fine Indigo2.
- The HPUX port has been retested and minor warnings have been fixed. Thanks
  Yusuf for testing.
- Other than those, the platforms we 'support' in README.FIRST are all still
  actively supported.

===================
configure and build
===================

- The configure script has been massively revamped, and all of the Makefiles
  have undergone serious spring cleaning.
- Most noticeable is that we generate make dependencies on the fly now. This
  requires you to have some sort of program that does this, which we detect;
  currently supported are X11 makedepend, mkdep, cc -xM if using Sun Workshop
  and falling back to cc -MM if none work. If your C compiler has options to
  generate make-style dependency info and you have none of the other programs,
  send a note to joshk@triplehelix.org.
- We now support an --enable-clobber option so that binaries are not moved to
  $NAME.old when making install if they already exist. This does not apply to 
  modules as a running ircd could core if the loaded modules are moved and then
  unloaded. If you forget this when configuring, use make CLOBBER=yes install;
  depending on your variety of make, this may or may not work.
- It is now possible to build the contrib modules into your statically linked
  ircd.

====================
internationalization
====================

- We now use our own .lang files to provide translated numeric messages. See
  doc/messages.txt for information on how to use it and how to write your own.

==================
networking support
==================

- IPv6 support is now automatically enabled/disabled depending on whether your
  kernel supports it or not and can co-exist peacefully with IPv4.
- Cryptlinks now use Nagle's TCP_NODELAY algorithm to save overhead and is
  hence, more stable. (Previously only used with ziplinks)

=============
ircd features
=============

- X-line (gecos ban) support has been added. X-lines are stored xline.conf
  just like klines and dlines are stored in kline.conf and dline.conf,
  respectively.
- Nick and channel RESVs are now stored in nresv.conf and cresv.conf, respectively.
- Bill Bierman has written clustering support for IRC networks that wish to share
  a common list of resvs, klines, xlines, and locops.
- New ACL G-lines can now be 'rejected' from being placed on the local server as
  well as 'blocked' from being propagated through the local server onto another
  server. Failures can also be logged for rejected and/or blocked glines.
- Testmask feature allows you to count number of local and remote clients for
  a given hostmask.
