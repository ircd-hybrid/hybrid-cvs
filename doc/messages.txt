     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Hybrid has obsoleted its buggy gettext support for i18n'd IRC status
   messages. It now supports its own .lang format.

   This document is split into two parts, using message files, and creating
   your own.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                    Using Provided or Pre-made Message Files

   There are a number of message files provided with Hybrid 7. These can be
   found in the source tree in messages/.

   These files are NOT installed by default; run `make install' within the
   messages directory to install them and they will automatically be used
   unless the paths in config.h were not adhered to.

   These message files can be used in ircd once they are installed. Try the
   installed message file with /quote SET MSGLOCALE <locale> first. The
   locale will be 'standard' for the plain messages that are Hybrid's
   default.

   If the desired message file works without any issues, it can be set to be
   the default message file in the ircd.conf file. Refer to example.conf's
   documentation on the message_locale setting.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                           Creating Your Own Messages

   This process is a little more complicated. The easiest way to start
   editing messages is to take a file such as custom.lang, make a copy,
   and change whichever status lines you wish.

   Once you have your customized message file ready, just copy it into the
   same place as the rest of the messages, typically /usr/local/ircd/messages.

   If you think your .lang file deserves to be in the official distribution,
   submit it to us at hybrid@the-project.org. It must be complete and as error-
   free as you can make it since it is subject to public consumption. Providing
   a translation will be a way that nearly anyone who knows multiple languages
   to contribute to ircd, and get their name in the translation credits.
