-- ircd-hybrid-7.0.1 RELNOTES
o) fixed ban desync bug caused by malformed ban strings
o) fixed two adns bugs, one would cause an infinite loop, another that
   would cause the resolver to simply stop working
o) fixed example.conf line that was missing a ; at the end
o) fixed whois bug that would allow remote requests to include wildcards
o) kline checking is reverted to hybrid-6 behaviour, this should alleviate
  the complaints about "sluggish" server klines. The behaviour in hybrid-6
  was to wait one io_loop() before checking clients for placed klines.
o) We've added remote unkline
o) A true "safelist", with borrowed constructs from undernet i.e.
  /list <10 list all channels with less than 10 members
o) The redundant mode code removed
o) tdline support
o) quote /xline support, these are saved/restored from xline.conf
o) quote resv are saved/restored from nresv.conf and cresv.conf
o) you wanted them, here they are... remote whois notices
o) hidden admin support
o) sjoins are shown as in old behaviour if server is not hidden
o) fixed remote operspy logging

This is the current release version of ircd-hybrid-7.

BUGS: Major bugs in this release are listed in BUGS

BUG REPORTS: If you run this code and encounter problems, you must report
 the bug in one of the following ways:
  a) By EMAIL to ircd-hybrid@the-project.org.  
 Please include a gdb backtrace and a copy of your config.h and ircd.conf 
 with any report  (with passwords and other sensitive information masked).

DISCUSSION: There is a mailing list for discussion of hybrid issues,
 including betas.  To subscribe, send an email to listmanager@the-project.org
 with a single line in the body containing "subscribe hybrid". This is the
 proper place to discuss new features, bugs, etc.  Posting here is much more
 likely to get something done than ranting on #TZ.

TESTING: This code is under active development, and a lot changes from beta
 to beta.  As the user of this code, we request that you help us test things
 which have changed recently, and which would benefeit from being tested
 much as possible.  The following are some things that have changed, and what
 you can do to help us test them.
     o) Exiting Clients
        - The way clients are exited and cleaned from memory has been largely
          redone since the last release.  Unusual situations involving clients
          exiting will help expose any remaining problems.
     o) Mac OS X Modules
        - Support for Darwin and Mac OS X style modules, through the
          NSModule(3) interface has been added, and is designed to work as
          loadable modules do on most UNIX systems.  Feeding it bad or
          duplicate modules to find bugs would be appriciated.
