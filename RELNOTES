-- ircd-hybrid-7.1beta1 RELNOTES
o) TS6 support has been introduced, although it is still not to be
   used on produce networks.
o) Halfops are no longer a configure option - if you prefer to use
   them, you have to patch the source against contrib/halfops.diff;
   anonops (+a) have been ripped out completely.
o) A new, more effective hash algorithm (from ircu).
o) Linebufs have been replaced with the new rewritten dbuf code;
   noticeable performance improvements to the network I/O system.
o) Major changes to the configure script.
o) LIST extensions borrowed from undernet (SAFELIST, channel filtering -
   see contrib/help/opers/list for more details).
o) A native i18n support is provided instead of the former gettext,
   which is no longer needed. Old message files have been updated
   according to the new format, plus some new translations are available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the current beta version of ircd-hybrid-7.1.

NOTE: This is still BETA code.  Run it at your own risk.  By running this
 code you assume FULL responsibility for any problems it may cause.  We do
 NOT recommend that you run BETA code on production IRC networks such
 as EFnet.

BUGS: Major bugs in this release are listed in BUGS

BUG REPORTS: If you run this code and encounter problems, you must report
 the bug in one of the following ways:
  a) By EMAIL to bugs@ircd-hybrid.org.  
 Please include a gdb backtrace and a copy of your config.h and ircd.conf 
 with any report  (with passwords and other sensitive information masked).

DISCUSSION: There is a mailing list for discussion of hybrid issues,
 including betas.  To subscribe, use this link:
    https://lists.ircd-hybrid.org/mailman/listinfo/hybrid
 This is the proper place to discuss new features, bugs, etc.  Posting here
 is much more likely to get something done than ranting on #TZ.

TESTING: This code is under active development, and a lot changes from beta
 to beta.  As the user of this code, we request that you help us test things
 which have changed recently, and which would benefeit from being tested
 much as possible.  The following are some things that have changed, and what
 you can do to help us test them.
     o) Exiting Clients
        - The way clients are exited and cleaned from memory has been largely
          redone since the last release.  Unusual situations involving clients
          exiting will help expose any remaining problems.
     o) Mac OS X Modules
        - Support for Darwin and Mac OS X style modules, through the
          NSModule(3) interface has been added, and is designed to work as
          loadable modules do on most UNIX systems.  Feeding it bad or
          duplicate modules to find bugs would be appriciated.
